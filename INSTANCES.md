## Community Instances

PLEASE do not use any rehost of monochrome and complain to us about features not working. They are usually out of date, and do not provide the latest features, and accounts are always broken.

## API Instances

WormHole uses the Hi-Fi API under the hood. Live, up-to-date status trackers (which return JSON) can be found below:

- [https://tidal-uptime.geeked.wtf](https://tidal-uptime.geeked.wtf)

These are available API endpoints that can be used with WormHole or other Hi-Fi based applications:
